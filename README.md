# F1 Generations - Python Passion Project

## Overview

F1 Generations is a Python-based simulation game that aims to let players experience the entire history of Formula 1 from the inaugural 1950 season to the 2024 season. Currently, the project simulates the 1950 season, with AI-generated race results based on driver performance calculations and DNFs. A basic UI is implemented to display the race standings, but there is no player interaction or score tracking yet.

## Current Features

- **1950 Season Simulation**: AI calculates driver positions and DNFs.
- **Basic UI**: Displays current race standings.
- **Automated Race Processing**: The game runs races autonomously.
- **Excel-to-Python reading:** Can read from Microsoft Excel spreadsheet
- **In-Depth Data:** Contains Extrensive data for all teams in history as well as tracks and drivers from a spreadsheet.

## Planned Improvements

- **UI Enhancements**:
  - Make windows scrollable for better navigation.
  - Improve race result display, including a starting grid view.
  - Make the UI more visually appealing.
- **Game Logic Refinements**:
  - Fix the history tab so it doesn’t repeat the same race endlessly.
  - Ensure drivers remain consistent within each season.
  - Avoid hardcoding references to a single year to allow expansion to future seasons.
  - Implement automatic history progression.
  - Develop a system to transition through seasons with evolving teams and drivers.
  - Remove drivers from selection once they have been assigned to avoid two teams having the same driver.
- **Data Tracking and Management**:
  - Track driver and constructor points per season.
  - Implement season data saving to allow continuity.
  - Implement retirement function at the end of each season

## Development Status

The game is still in early development, and I am working on it as a passion project alongside my studies when time permits. There's a long way to go, but I am excited about expanding the game’s depth and historical accuracy.

## Future Goals

- Implement user interaction, allowing players to make strategic choices.
- Expand simulations to cover all seasons from 1950-2024.
- Add dynamic elements like evolving car performance, team changes, and driver careers.
- Create a detailed statistics tracking system.
